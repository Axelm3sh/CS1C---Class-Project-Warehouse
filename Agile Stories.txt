#x  - ...
  a. Story Point:  Xpts  -TeamMember
  b. Priority:  1-High 10-Low (ie. 3 -TeamMember)
  c. Tasks and Tests: "Description of specific task and test 
                        inside a text block" -TeamMember
                        
  d. Finished Condition: "Opinion: Finished condition when x is fulfilled" -TeamMember
====================================
#3 - As a manager, I would like to know the total amount of purchased items from premium/preferred members
in an organized list. At the end of the list I would like to see the grand total of purchases.
  a. Story Point: 5pts -Dan
  
  b. Priority:  3 -Dan 
  c. Task and Tests: Let's implement the item's class and then create an test that randomly generates item prices.
                     To test the grand total, a function/method must total up all prices while reading down a list.
                     To test the organized list, we need a sortting function/method that will sort ID numbers in numeric order.
                     -Dan
  d. Finished Condition: All above tests and methods will work together to spit out a simple output.
  
#4 - As a manager, I would like to be able to enter an item name and get the quantity of that item sold as well
as its total price sold for that specific item.
  a. Story Point: 2pts -Dan
  b. Priority: 5 -Dan
  c. Tasks and Tests: Create a function/method that gets the item name and then output how many were sold then
					  we could total it up. Most likely either requires a two-step process for searching the item
					  then getting its price and tallying it up.
					  Check all items(?)
  d. Finished Condition: All of the above implementation should be functional.

====================================
  
#7 - As a manager, I want to create a detailed list of the amount of money paid for by each store member 
every year and sorted by member type so that we can see how much each memberâ€™s payment is due. 
  a. Estimation: 4
  b. Priority: 5
  c. Tasks and Tests: 
        i. Should have a properly formatted output
        ii. Should have the list sorted by members
  d. Definition of Done: The list is properly sorted and formatted in a clean way. 

#8 - As a manager, I want to be able to enter in a month and see what members have their memberships expiring at 
the end of the month so that we can see how much payment is due 
  a. Estimation: 4
  b. Priority 4
  c. Tasks and Tests: 
        i. Should be properly formatted
        ii. Test if the month outputs appropriate membership expiring and amount due
  d. Definition of Done: The user can see which memberships expire and the amount due in a formatted way. 

#10 - As a manager, I want to be able to see if a basic member should upgrade to preferred members so that we 
can start charging them membership. 
  a. Estimation: 2 
  b. Priority 9
  c. Tasks and Tests: 
        i. Properly formatted output 
        ii. Test if the user upgrades their membership
  d. Definition of Done: The user should have a list of users who should upgrade to preferred membership.
