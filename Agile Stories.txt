#3 - As a manager, I would like to know the total amount of purchased items from premium/preferred members
in an organized list. At the end of the list I would like to see the grand total of purchases.
  a. Story Point: 5pts -Dan
  
  b. Priority:  3 -Dan 
  c. Task and Tests: Let's implement the item's class and then create an test that randomly generates item prices.
                     To test the grand total, a function/method must total up all prices while reading down a list.
                     To test the organized list, we need a sortting function/method that will sort ID numbers in numeric order.
                     -Dan
  d. Finished Condition: All above tests and methods will work together to spit out a simple output.
